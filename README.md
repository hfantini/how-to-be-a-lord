This app was developed for android mobiles with aim to familiarize with the platform. I wrote all application code in Java with Android SDK. My friend Lucas Tonello took care about the design and graphics. The development (Including the phase of planning and requirements gathering) took something around 3 months to be completed. The idea behind this app is providing a way of relaxation to the user through the combination of fireplace, classic music and rain.
